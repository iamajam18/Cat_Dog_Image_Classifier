As part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculum, I completed the "Cat and Dog Image Classifier" project, where I built a model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. To enhance the dataset, I used the Image Data Generator for image augmentation, including horizontal and vertical flipping, zooming, and shifting. I then employed Convolutional Neural Networks for the classification task.

This project improved my confidence in handling deep learning and image processing tasks and increased my enthusiasm for image-based projects.
